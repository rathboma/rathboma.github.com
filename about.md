## Hi There
I'm an entrepreneur and CEO of [Beekeeper Data](http://beekeeperdata.com), a company I started after getting frustrated with data sharing tools for Hadoop. It is loosly based on an internal project I built while at Foursquare, also called Beekeeper.

More importantly I'm a father and husband, and would not be here today without my [super smart and supportive wife, Alexandra](http://alexandrapavlakis.com).

## This Website

'Big data' is a total mess of competing technologies, concepts, and workflows and getting started with any sort of project in this area is very tough. I started blogging about Hadoop and Big Data after overcoming a challenging bug and wanting to warn others. It sort of blossomed from that into a range of articles and tutorials aimed at helping newcomers find their way in this rapidly changing industry.

My goal is to make your life with Hadoop and related technologies easier, so let me know how I can help!


## My Experiences


Prior to Beekeeper, I worked on real-time analytics at [Drop.io](http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/29/facebook-acquires-drop-io-nabs-sam-lessin/), built data infrastructure at [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com), and led the server engineering and system architecture teams at [Shoutlet](http://shoutlet.com).

I've spent a lot of time building Hadoop clusters, data ingestion pipelines, data reporting software, map-reduce jobs, and all sorts of horrible hacks to get nice clean data.

I have a MS in Computer Science from the [NYU Courant School of Mathematics](https://www.cs.nyu.edu/), and a LLB Law Degree from [Northumbria Unversity](http://northumbria.ac.uk).
